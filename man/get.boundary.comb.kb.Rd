\description{
Generates the optimal dose escalation and de-escalation boundaries for
conducting a drug-combination trial with the KEYBOARD design.
}
\details{
The KEYBOARD design relies on the posterior distribution of the toxicity
probability to guide dosage. To make the decision of dose escalation and
de-escalation, given the observed data at the current dose, we identify the
interval that has the highest posterior probability, which we refer to as
the "strongest key". This key represents where the true dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) rate of the current dose is most likely located. If the
strongest key is located on the left side of the "target key", we escalate
the dose (because it means that the observed data suggests that the current
dose is most likely to represent under-dosing); if the strongest key is
located on the right side of the target key, we de-escalate the dose
(because the data suggests that the current dose represents overdosing); and
if the strongest key is the target key, we retain the current dose (because
the observed data supports that the current dose is most likely to be in the
proper dosing interval).
Graphically, the strongest key is the one with the largest area under the
posterior distribution curve of the DLT rate of the current dose.

An attractive feature of the KEYBOARD design is that its dose escalation and
de-escalation rule can be tabulated before the onset of the trial. Thus,
when conducting the trial, no calculation or model fitting is needed, and we
only need to count the number of DLTs observed at the current dose and make
the decision of dose escalation and de-escalation based on the pre-tabulated
decision rules.

Given all observed data, we use matrix isotonic regression to obtain the
estimate of the toxicity rate of the combination of dose level j of drug A
and dose level k of drug B, and select the MTD as the combination with the
toxicity estimate that is closest to the target. When there are ties, we
randomly choose one as the MTD.

For patient safety, we apply the following Bayesian overdose control rule
after each cohort:
if at least 3 patients have been treated at the given dose and
the observed data indicate that the probability of the toxicity rate of
the current combination dose being above the target toxicity rate is more
than 95%, we eliminate that and higher doses from the trial to prevent
exposing future patients to these overly toxic doses. The probability
threshold can be specified with \code{cutoff.eli}. If the lowest dose
combination (1, 1) is overly toxic, the trial terminates early and no dose
is selected as the MTD.
}
\note{
In most clinical applications, the target DLT rate is often a rough
  guess, but finding a dose level with a DLT rate reasonably close to the
  target rate (which ideally would be the MTD) is what interests the
  investigator.
