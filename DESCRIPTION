Description: We implement a recently developed methodology and develope a package 'Keyboard' for designing single-agent, drug-combination, or phase I/II dose-finding clinical trials. The 'Keyboard' designs are novel early phase trial designs that can be implemented simply and transparently, similar to the 3+3 design, but yield excellent performance, comparable to those of more-complicated, model-based designs. The 'Keyboard' package provides tools for designing, conducting, and analyzing single-agent, drug-combination, and phase I/II dose-finding clinical trials.
