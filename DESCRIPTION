Description: This is an R package KEYBOARD, which implements a recently developed methodology for designing single-agent, drug-combination and phase I/II dose-finding clinical. The KEYBOARD designs are novel phase I trial designs that can be implemented simply and transparently, similar to the 3+3 design, but yield excellent performance comparable to those of more complicated, model-based designs. The KEYBOAD package provides tools for designing, conducting, and analyzing single-agent, drug-combination, and phase I/II dose-finding clinical trials.
